# TS1015_CEL-Seq2_pipeline

#This folder contains the files and scripts used to process the sequences obtained by CEL-Seq2.

#Note, the final output of all of the samples and the read counts from the two lanes (demultiplexed and mapped using the same CEL-Seq pipeline) compiled into the counting reports used for downstream analyses.
